# PyPad
A simple cross-platform python editing notepad written in python.

This editor is fully customizable, just edit the config.yaml file. All color codes  **MUST** be hex color codes!

Required modules: PyQt5

Full Credit for this idea goes to [Fuchsiaff](https://github.com/Fuchsiaff)

Basic config.yaml:

```yaml
colorscheme:
  search_dir: "./colorschemes"
  active_scheme: "basic"

```
